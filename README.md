Use RNN to model handwriting using Theano blocks.
I am trying to reproduce the simplest handwritting model given by
[Alex Graves](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850),
see also his [demo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/handwriting.html)

Dependencies
------------
* [Blocks](https://github.com/bartvm/blocks) follow
  the [install instructions](http://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html).
  This will install all the other dependencies for you (Theano, Fuel, etc.).
  However I am using few changes I made to blocks that are available in
  [my fork of blocks](https://github.com/udibr/blocks). You can either install
  my fork or copy paste the changes:
  * [Xavier weight initialization](https://github.com/udibr/blocks/blob/master/blocks/initialization.py#L228)
  * [Add bias to Fork class](https://github.com/udibr/blocks/blob/master/blocks/bricks/parallel.py#L101)
* Download handwritting dataset using [this notebook](./handwriting-to-hdf5.ipynb)
 
Running code
------------

    python sketch.py
Generates a directory where the model is saved and
after every epoch it generate random samples of handwritting generated by the
model in `samples-sketch.png` for each example, a diagram showing where the pen
was raised is shown in `samples-pen.png`

Notes
-----
* This is a work in progress
