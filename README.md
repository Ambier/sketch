# sketch
Use RNN to model handwriting using Theano blocks.
I am trying to reproduce the simplest handwritting model given by
Alex Graves http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850
see also his [demo](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/handwriting.html)

Dependencies
------------
 * [Blocks](https://github.com/bartvm/blocks) follow
the [install instructions](http://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html).
This will install all the other dependencies for you (Theano, Fuel, etc.).
However I am using Xavier weight initialization which currently is available
only on [my fork of blocks](https://github.com/udibr/blocks)
 * Download data set using [this](./handwriting-to-hdf5.ipynb) notebook
 
Running code
------------

    python sketch.py
should do the work. It generates a directory where the model is saved and
after every epoch it generate random samples of handwritting generated by the
model in `samples-sketch.png` for each example, a diagram showing where the pen
was raised is shown in `samples-pen.png`

Notes
-----
 * This is a work in progress
 * dropout does not work for now
